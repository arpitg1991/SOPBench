I recommend speaking with your academic advisor about steps to clear your probation status.

However, your application was still accepted, so it appears there may be exceptions to this requirement or other factors in your profile that qualified you.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about your financial aid application or any other academic services?",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\nThe constraints are organized hierarchically:\n- 'ALL of these conditions must be met' indicates that every listed condition is required (AND logic)\n- 'ANY ONE of these conditions must be met' indicates that at least one condition is required (OR logic)\n- 'These steps must be completed in order' indicates a sequence that must be followed (CHAIN logic)\nNumbered items (1., 2., etc.) represent ordered steps, while bulleted items (\u2022) represent unordered conditions.\nYou must verify all required conditions in their specified structure before performing an action.\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nNone\n\n* enroll_course:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** completed all prerequisite courses listed for the course \"course_code\" in order to enroll.\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST FALL** within the academic registration period as defined in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The course \"course_code\" **MUST HAVE** available seats remaining (enrolled < capacity).\n\u2022 The total credits for the student \"username\" after enrolling in course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT EXCEED** the maximum credit limit of 18.\n\u2022 The schedule of the course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT OVERLAP** with any of the student's existing enrolled courses.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** at least 90 completed credits to enroll in an upper-division course.\n\u2022 The course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT** already be completed by the student \"username\".\n\u2022 The exam schedule for course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT CONFLICT** with any of the student's other enrolled course exam times.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST BE** in a major allowed by the course \"course_code\" major restrictions.\n\n* drop_course:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 Student \"username\" **MUST BE CURRENTLY ENROLLED** in course \"course_code\"\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 After dropping course \"course_code\", student \"username\" **MUST RETAIN** at least 12 credits (current credits - course credits)\n\u2022 Current interaction time **MUST BE BEFORE** the withdrawal deadline in academic calendar\n\n* request_graduation:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** all required courses for their declared major.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** at least 10 general education courses (course codes starting with 'GEN').\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** at least 180 total credits to graduate.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** a GPA greater than or equal to the minimum required GPA of 2.0 to graduate.\n\u2022 The tuition balance for student \"username\" **MUST BE ZERO OR LESS** in order to proceed with graduation.\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST BE BEFORE** the official graduation deadline in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST NOT BE** on academic probation in order to perform this action.\n\n* change_major:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The GPA of student \"username\" **MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO** the minimum GPA required for the new major \"new_major\".\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST FALL** before or on the major change deadline in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** made fewer than 3 major changes in total.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** completed at least 45 credits to be eligible for a major change.\n\u2022 The target major \"new_major\" **MUST HAVE** available capacity (current enrolled students < defined capacity limit) to accept new change requests.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Although your student record shows you're enrolled in CS101, the system cannot find the course details, which is preventing me from processing your withdrawal.\n\nThis could be due to a technical issue in our database. Since I can see that you are indeed enrolled in CS101 according to your student record, I recommend contacting the Registrar's Office directly to process this withdrawal. They can manually handle this situation and ensure your withdrawal is properly recorded before the December 1, 2023 deadline.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today?",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

CS201 has available seats (24/25 enrolled) \u2713\n5.

The issue is that your current credit load is 16 credits, and CS201 is a 4-credit course. Adding this course would bring your total to 20 credits, which exceeds the maximum allowed credit limit of 18 credits.\n\nYou would need to drop a course first to reduce your credit load before enrolling in CS201.

Prerequisites: CS201 requires CS101, which you have completed \u2713\n3. Registration period: Current date (Nov 15) is within the registration period (Nov 1-30) \u2713\n4. Course availability: CS201 has 25 capacity with 24 enrolled, so there is 1 seat available \u2713\n5. Credit limit: Your current credits (4) + CS201 credits (4) = 8, which is below the 12 credit maximum \u2713\n6. Schedule conflicts: CS201 (Tue/Thu 14:00-15:30) doesn't conflict with CS101 (Mon/Wed 10:00-11:30) \u2713\n7. Upper-division requirement: CS201 is an upper-division course requiring 90+ credits, but you only have 45 credits \u2717\n8. Course not already completed: You haven't completed CS201 yet \u2713\n9. Exam schedule conflicts: No conflicts between CS201 (Dec 16) and CS101 (Dec 15) \u2713\n10. Major restrictions: CS201 is restricted to Computer Science majors, which matches your major \u2713\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot proceed with your enrollment in CS201 because you don't meet one of the requirements. Specifically, CS201 is an upper-division course that requires at least 90 completed credits, but you currently have only 45 credits.\n\nI recommend continuing with your current coursework to accumulate more credits before attempting to enroll in CS201. Would you like me to help you find other courses that might be suitable for your current credit level?",

You would need to complete additional coursework to reach the 90-credit threshold before being eligible for this upper-division course.\n\nSince I've completed the analysis of your enrollment request and provided you with the reason why enrollment cannot proceed at this time, I'll end our conversation as requested.",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.
